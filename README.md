# language-grammar
Formal grammar definition for the PlantUML language, designed for syntax parsing, validation, and editor integration.

## Objectives
- Build upon the excellent work from [vscode-plantuml](https://github.com/qjebbs/vscode-plantuml).
- Become the official source for the PlantUML syntax used by [GitHub Linguist](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/main/vendor/README.md).
- Enable the maintenance of syntax definitions for multiple tools and platforms, such as:
  - **Visual Studio Code**: Improved syntax highlighting and parsing extensions.
  - **GitHub Linguist**: For accurate language detection and rendering on GitHub.
  - **JetBrains IDEs**: Syntax support for IntelliJ IDEA, PyCharm, etc.
  - **TextMate/Atom**: Legacy syntax definitions for these editors.
  - **Tree-sitter**: For modern syntax parsing in tools like Neovim.
  - **Sublime Text**: Updated syntax highlighting packages.
  - **ACE Editor**: Syntax highlighting support for this lightweight, embeddable code editor.
  - **Online editors**: Such as GitPod or web-based IDEs.
  - **Language servers (LSP)**: Providing advanced features like autocompletion and diagnostics.
